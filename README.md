# GATv2-RNI

EXP and CEXP dataset generation and RNI implementation are based on https://github.com/ralphabb/GNN-RNI.
(Besides model structure and output structure, some other modifications are made to make it compatible with pytorch_geometric 2.x.)

Newly generated EXP and CEXP dataset: /Data (compatible with pytorch_geometric 2.x.) 

Output evaluation: GAT_RNI_output.ipynb
